Project Overview
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of operations, supply chain, and logistics for Winter Rock, with a focus on sales trends, forecasting, distribution optimization, and strategic evaluation of introducing new products. The core objective is to deliver actionable insights and recommendations to enhance operational efficiency, optimize distribution costs, and mitigate risks in new product launches.

Key Sections and Activities
1. Sales Trends Analysis
Objective: Evaluate seasonal sales variations and trends to inform marketing and inventory strategies.
Methodology:
Utilized a 12-month centered moving average to smooth data irregularities and uncover underlying patterns.
Created a seasonal matrix to analyze deviations in sales across months and years.
Identified sharp winter sales peaks due to demand for skiing products, followed by spring dips.
Findings:
Marketing efforts should target spring and summer to counteract sales dips.
Inventory should align with seasonal demand, scaling up for winter.
2. Forecasting Year-Round Products
Objective: Forecast sales for non-seasonal items like hiking shoes and t-shirts.
Methodology:
Employed Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) with an alpha value of 0.5 for moderate sensitivity.
Assessed forecast accuracy using in-sample and out-of-sample metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error).
Findings:
SES performed adequately but showed errors in out-of-sample data, signaling the need for more robust forecasting models.
3. Distribution Optimization
Objective: Minimize costs while meeting regional demands.
Methodology:
Used a Linear Programming (LP) model to allocate shipments from Manchester and London distribution centers.
Optimized allocations based on regional demand and center capacity constraints.
Findings:
Total distribution cost: £99,615.
Optimal distribution plan:
Manchester to supply 2,000 units to East and 500 to North.
London to supply 930 units to West and 1,700 to North.
Efficient capacity utilization with flexibility for scaling.
4. Strategic Evaluation for New Product (Ski Bindings)
Objective: Determine supplier strategy for new product introduction under uncertain demand.
Methodology:
Compared European and U.S. suppliers based on costs, risks, and demand scenarios.
Evaluated profit outcomes for low (500 units) and high (1,000 units) demand.
Used decision trees to assess risk-averse, risk-seeking, and expected profit scenarios.
Findings:
Europe: Lower financial risk with consistent profits but limited capacity.
U.S.: Higher potential profits with fixed costs posing risks in low-demand scenarios.
Recommendation: Start with Europe for minimal risk, transitioning to the U.S. for scalability in high-demand conditions.
5. Simulation Analysis for Random Demand
Objective: Assess financial impacts of unpredictable demand (200–800 units) for low-cost mountain skis.
Methodology:
Conducted simulations using a uniform distribution to model potential demand.
Compared average profit, costs, and profit volatility between suppliers.
Findings:
Europe: Lower profits (£12,668.68 on average) but stable with lower risk.
U.S.: Higher profits (£19,726.01 on average) but greater risk due to profit volatility.
Recommendation: Use Europe for stable demand and consider U.S. for profit maximization in high-demand scenarios.
Conclusions and Recommendations
Sales Trends: Adjust inventory and marketing efforts to align with seasonal demand fluctuations.
Forecasting: Invest in advanced forecasting models for improved accuracy and decision-making.
Distribution: Maintain cost-effective supply chains with optimized allocations and scalable capacity.
New Products: Begin with European suppliers for safer entry into new markets, transitioning to U.S. suppliers as demand grows.
Risk Management: Combine suppliers where possible to balance stability and profit potential, leveraging each region's strengths.
This analysis offers Winter Rock actionable insights for enhancing operational strategies, maximizing profitability, and managing risks effectively.
